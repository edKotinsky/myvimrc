# My nvim config

Plain, but powerful.

I'm trying to keep my config lightweight as possible to not slow down my 
old PC. So you can't see here any custom fonts and icons, but the mix of 
plugins, written on VimScript with plugins, written on Lua. 

The main reason, why I put my config here, in public repository, is 
possibility to download and install it somewhere else.

Sometimes something may be broken because of my experiments.
